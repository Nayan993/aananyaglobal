              <div class="text">
                I was born in Konda village of district Bastar (then Madhya
                Pradesh) and received my primary education in Shri Ramakrishna
                Mission School. In my adolescence, I joined Swami Vivekananda
                Foundation, Belur Math and during this time, at the young age of
                6, I got engaged in various social works for the upliftment of
                the local tribal society. Got the highest position in class five
                in the then Madhya Pradesh Education Board. I received my
                secondary and higher education from Lucknow, the capital of
                Uttar Pradesh, where I was considered a bright student with deep
                social commitment.

          From 1990 onwards I worked continuously for the party membership
          campaign and during 1993, Lucknow (where I worked continuously for
          this sacred cause) got the first position in the overall membership
          nomination of BJP. My name was proposed for the member of Uttar
          Pradesh Assembly elections but I was not of appropriate age and for
          me, giving higher priority to the building and publicity of the party,
          it was more important than personal ambitions. In the year 1994-1995,
          during the election of Late Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee as MP from
          Lucknow, on the instructions of Late Shri Shiv Kumar, I kept working
          on building an organization at the grassroots level. It was my great
          good fortune to have the experience of working with the world's most
          famous Prime Minister, respected Shri Narendra Bhai Modi Ji as a
          journalist/BJP worker during the year 1997-1999 and after the Gujarat
          riots, I got the experience of working with the then Gujarat
          government. I had made a huge contribution in the print media to
          create a counter narrative in favor of the Gujarat administration in
          favor of the Chief Minister.
