            of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste material in construction
            projects. I banned the use of clay bricks in all metro cities in

            basis.

          <li>
            I started Special Greening Drive in which more than 60,000 trees
            were planted in Delhi in a month’s time. I extended the Drive to all
            parts of the country in the 100 Days’ Programme successfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            I introduced a new policy of comprehensive outsourcing of

            big way.
          </li>
          <li>
            I decided to introduce the EPC mode of tendering for all our
            projects for their fast-track completion. To make it user-friendly I
            developed 3 different modules of EPC mode of tendering in CPWD which
            proved to be very useful for the users.
          </li>
          <li>
            To improve the visibility of CPWD I decided to connect the New
            Homepage of CPWD website with Twitter handle, Facebook and U- Tube
            Channel.
          </li>
          <li>
            I ordered a special drive to clear all old audit paras in CPWD which
            resulted in dropping of about 10,000 audit paras which was a great
            achievement.
          </li>
          <li>
            I gave special thrust to e-governance in all facets of working of
            CPWD which resulted in transparent functioning and better
            performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            I got the much-awaited Cadre Review of Horticulture Wing cleared and
            implemented which improved their performance
          </li>
          <li>
            To encourage and motivate the staff and officers deployed in
            construction and maintenance I introduced a scheme of awards for
            best performance to be given on a regular basis at short intervals
            which proved to be very successful in improving the overall
            performance of CPWD.
          </li>
          <li>
            To ease out hardship of staff due to frequent transfers I declared
            21 more stations all over India as “Hard & Unpopular”. The staff
            posted in these places were given incentive of choice posting after
            two years of their stay.
          </li>
          <li>
            I introduced a work-centric transfer/posting policy for posting
            staff on the identified “Work Centers” which resulted in improved
            performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            I ensured that CPWD participated in the Pravasi Bhartiya Diwas at
            Varanasi and the Vibrant Gujarat Summit at Gandhi Nagar in a grand
            manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            As Director General for only 19 months, I turned around a sick
            organization of CPWD by introducing all-round sweeping reforms and
            innovations in finance, technology, management, training & skill
            development, R&D etc. As a result, even when the GDP was going down
            and the Real Estate Sector was on a down-turn the growth of work
            order of CPWD increased by a phenomenal 2,500%, from a mere Rs
            10,000 Cr to a whopping Rs 2,50,000 Cr. This is perhaps the biggest
            turnaround in the world's history of management for a huge
            organization like CPWD spread all over India in its remotest corners
            and also in some foreign countries.
          </li>
          <li>
            During this period CPWD had undergone an unprecedented paradigm
            change and witnessed a new lease of life in its overall functioning.
            It has scaled new heights with tremendous momentum of growth and
            transformed into a most modern, efficient and delivery-oriented
            organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduced and implemented Restructuring and Delayering in CPWD and
            improved its performance manyfold. I reduced decision-making levels
            from 7 to 4 and made decision-making faster. I defined authority,
            responsibility and accountability at every level very clearly and
            ensured faster delivery and improved client satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            With my efforts CPWD became the first Civil organization in
            Government in which all transactions were being done online
            mandatorily. In this way I introduced complete transparency in all
            decision-making in a big way and, in turn, eradicated corruption
            completely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduced a Training Policy in CPWD for the first time and worked
            for skill upgradation at all levels. On-site skilling camps were
            organized for the skilling of regular and contractor workers all
            over India. Several lakh of workers were trained and certificates
            were issued free of cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            I established an R&D in collaboration with IIT Gandhinagar to
            introduce innovation and new technologies in construction and
            maintenance works in CPWD for the first time. More than 50 new
            technologies were identified and introduced for faster, sustainable
            and economic construction against only 3 technologies in use
            earlier.
          </li>
          <li>
            I revised the complicated and 460 pages long voluminous CPWD Works
            Manual to simplified and result-oriented only 54 pages and made it
            work-centric, delivery and client satisfaction oriented reducing
            time and cost of projects and other works drastically.
          </li>
          <li>
            I developed and published our own Green Building Rating Manual and
            Standards in CPWD namely “GHAR” suitable for our country which is
            better than all other prevailing standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the first time “Business Meet” were conducted by me all over
            India with more than 600 clients reviewing more than 3000 projects
            which gave phenomenal impetus to performance improvement and client
            satisfaction in CPWD.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the first time in CPWD I organized more than 10 Technical
            Seminars at the national level on burning topics of sustainable
            construction, new materials, energy and water conservation,
            innovative public architecture, high-rise buildings, landscaping
            etc. improving professional
          </li>
          <li>
            I organized regular meetings with RWAs, Contractor Associations and
            Service Associations. “Contractors Conclave” were organized all over
            India. This resulted in making system improvement and delivering
            improved services and better client satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hon’ble LG of Ladakh invited me to take up the work of building the
            capital city of Leh and Kargil. Hon’ble Chief Minister of Himachal
            Pradesh also gave several important projects to CPWD when I met him
            in Shimla. I held several such meetings with VIPs and heads of
            Institutions with very fruitful results in terms of improving
            work-load of CPWD.
          </li>
          <li>
            As Chairman of the Technical Committee of Global Housing Technology
            Challenge, I processed and selected suitable technologies from a
            large number of applicants from Global level in the event organized
            at Vigyan Bhavan on March 2-3, 2019, which was inaugurated by Shri
            Narendra Modi Ji, hon’ble Prime Minister of India. I identified the
            technologies and assigned it to different lighthouse projects
            distributed all over India successfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji has acknowledged and
            appreciated in at least three public functions at different places
            on different occasions about the extra-ordinary performance of CPWD
            in my leadership completing its projects within the stipulated cost
            and time which was unthinkable in the Government set-up so far.
